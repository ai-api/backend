# WARNING, DO NOT USE NPM COMMANDS, USE YARN!!

## Typescript
[Here's](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/) a good resource for learning more about Typescript

## Install Guide
 1. Install [yarn] (https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable). (Basically better, newer version of npm)
 2. Run `yarn install`

 ## How to Run
 Basically, you have 3 commands to run
  1. `yarn build` - Transpiles ts files into js files that will be found in bin/
  2. `yarn start` - Runs the most recently transpiled version of the code
  3. `yarn dev` - Transpiles and runs (Prob wanna use this one)
